There are three runtime libraries constructed from the source code and headers
under this directory via the standard HEADAS hmake mechanism.

All general telemetry (TLM) related functions which support both HXI and SGD are
organized into libahtlm.

All HXI instrument specific functions should be organized into libhxi.so.

All SGD instrument specific functions should be organized into libsgd.so.

As library functions and data structures become more mature in the build process,
general functionally shall be "refactored" out of instrument specific implementations
into the general library -- i.e. moved from either libahhxi or libahsgd into libahtlm,
and/or perhaps a new (Build 2.0) library called libahinstrum.

Essential contents of the library source directories:

README -- this file.
Makefile -- standard hmake Makefile.

Composition of libahtlm.so:
ahtlm/ahtlm:  ahBits.h ahSlice.h ahTLM.h ahTLMinfoCache.h ahTLMIO.h
ahtlm/src: ahBits.cxx ahErrHashFITS.cxx ahSlice.cxx ahTLM.cxx ahTLMinfoCache.cxx ahTLMIO.cxx

Composition of libahhxi.so:
ahhxi/ahhxi: ahHXItyps.h
ahhxi/src: doHXI.cxx doHXItest.cxx HXItemplate.cxx ioHXI.cxx lutHXI.cxx

Composition of libahsgd.so:
ahsgd/ahsgd: ahSGDtyps.h 
ahsgd/src: doSGD.cxx doSGDtest.cxx ioSGD.cxx lutSGD.cxx SGDtemplate.cxx
